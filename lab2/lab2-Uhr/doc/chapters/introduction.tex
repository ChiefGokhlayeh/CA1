\chapter{Introduction}

Purpose of this document is to describe and explain the inner workings of the digital clock application, created as part of lab exercise 4.1 in the Computer Architecture course at the University of Esslingen.

A description of operation, functional and non-functional requirements; as well as design requirements are described in the lab exercise sheet. This document will focus on \emph{how} things are implemented, not \emph{why}.

The manual is structured in chapters, each describing an individual module. A module description consists of the public interface, used to interact with other modules; as well as implementation details.
